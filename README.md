## User Story:

As a user, I want to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should track my distance traveled.

## Purpose:

A user will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
